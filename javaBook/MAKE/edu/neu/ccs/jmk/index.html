<H1>Make in Java</H1>

Have you ever noticed that there are two kinds of makefiles delivered
with Sun's Bean Box?  GNU make is used on machines running Unix, and
Microsoft's nmake is used on machines running Microsoft Windows.  Have
you ever wonder if Java could be used to implement a cross platform
make utility?  Make in Java is that utility.

<p>Make in Java (<tt>jmk</tt>) is an application which is used to ensure
that a set of files is in a consistent state. If <tt>jmk</tt> detects
an inconsistency, it executes commands that correct the
inconsistency. <tt>jmk</tt> is based on the make utility which is part
of most Unix systems, but is designed to be easily run on a variety of
machines and operating systems.

<p>Make in Java can be run in text mode by a shell.  Alternatively, it
will create its own graphical user interface.  The GUI presents the
results of make runs initiated by menu selection or keyboard commands.
A makefile can be reloaded by the GUI.  The targets of the make can
also be changed.

<p>Make in Java is freely redistributable software so that the utility
can follow any code that uses it.  It should be of interest to any one
distributing source code along with automated instructions that
describe how to construct the program from the source code.

<h2>Incompatibility Notice</h2>

Version 1.0 and above use semicolon as the generic path separator
character, while earlier versions used colon.  Semicolon was adopted
so as to allow the use of colon in a file name.  Old makefiles that
use generic path lists must be modified to reflect this change.

<h2>Installation</h2>

If your Java virual machine accepts the <tt>-jar</tt> option, you can
run <tt>jmk</tt> with the command:
<blockquote>
<b><tt>java -jar jmk.jar</tt></b> 
[ <a href="jmk.html#options">options</a> ] [ target ]*
</blockquote>

The main entry point to <tt>jmk</tt> is in the class
<tt>edu.neu.ccs.jmk.Make</tt>.  If your Java virual machine does not
accept the <tt>-jar</tt> option, place the JAR file in the class path
and start the virtual machine with that class.  The JAR file contains
scripts for some operating systems that may serve as useful templates.

<p>To test the installation with JDK 1.2, extract the contents of the
JAR file into an inferior directory and change to the directory.
Start <tt>jmk</tt> with the command
<blockquote>
<tt>java -jar ../jmk.jar -f edu/neu/ccs/jmk/makefile.jmk</tt>  
</blockquote>
This should create <tt>jmk.jar</tt> from its sources.

<p>Window appearance preferences can be set by placing the file 
<tt><a href="jmk.html#properties">jmk.properties</a></tt>
in the class path.

<h2>Hints</h2>

The rules given in a <tt>jmk</tt> makefile can invoke programs as
separate processes.  To produce a machine independent makefile, a
makefile should only exec programs that use the same command line
argument syntax across platforms.  Examples of such programs include
Sun's Java compiler (<tt>javac</tt>) and their Java Archive Tool
(<tt>jar</tt>).

<h2>Thanks</h2>
