<H1>Changes to Make in Java</H1>

<p>The current Make in Java is version 1.4 released on 21 September 2000.

<ul>

<li>Added $Id: changes.html,v 1.1.1.1 2000/09/26 11:20:34 ramsdell Exp $ tags for use with CVS.

<li>Moved sources to <a
href="http://jmk.sourceforge.net">http://jmk.sourceforge.net</a>.

</ul>

<p>The current Make in Java is version 1.3 released on 19 October 1999.

<h2>Changes from version 1.2 to version 1.3</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added a recursive delete operator called delall.
<li>Added filter function example to the documentation.
<li>Documentation corrected to state the purpose of JMK is to support
the task of writing platform independent makefiles.
</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 1.1 to version 1.2</h2>

<ul>
<li>Swing GUI changes.
<ul>
  <li>Word wrapping.</li>
  <li>Color Hilightning.</li>
  <li>Load/Save Properties.</li>
  <li>Mac look and feel.</li>
  <li>Flag indicator.</li>
</ul>

<li>File names given to the glob function and file operators may
contain more than one wild card character.
</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 1.0 to version 1.1</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Made the enter key start a make process in the swing interface.
  <li>Added functions first, rest, dirs, and load.  See the section on
  <a href="jmk.html#functions">functions</a> in the user documentation.
  <li>Changed the license to the Lesser General Public License.
</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 0.9 to version 1.0</h2>

<ul>
<li>The generic path separator character has been changed from colon
to semicolon.  Old makefiles that use generic path lists must be modified
to reflect this change.
</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 0.8 to version 0.9</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>-s</tt> option gives a new graphical interface based on Swing.
Olivier Refalo contributed the interface.

<li>The AWT graphical interface is invoked when there is a linkage
failure in the swing interface.

<li>Expressions in the commands associated with a rule are evaluated
when the rule's commands are executed.  

<li>There are now two types of
values used to specify rules: lists of strings and functions.  Syntax
has been added to allow the construction of user defined functions.
The new syntax causes the following incompatible changes:
<ul>
<li><tt>function</tt> and <tt>do</tt> are now reserved words.
<li>There is no longer a separate name space for functions.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 0.7 to version 0.8</h2>

<ul>
<li>A command preceded by "-" ignores errors.
<li>File operations try all arguments before failing.
<li>appendLine and appendLongLine in MakeWindow are no longer synchronized.
<li>The online documentation pages conform to the HTML 4.0 traditional DTD.
</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 0.6 to version 0.7</h2>

<ul>
<li> Fixed a bug in file last modified time caching.
<li> Recursive makes implemented.  All prerequisites of a target are
made before the target is analyzed.
<li> Added class edu.neu.ccs.jmk.shell.Kawa which allows commands
to be written in Scheme.
<li> Fixed a bug in parse error messages as the line number was always
one less than it should be.
<li> Removed Linux JDK 1.1.3 hacks.  All is fine under Linux JDK
1.1.6.
<li> Added Make Writer, a writer for output to the make window.  This
object eliminates the need for a thread.
</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 0.5 to version 0.6</h2>

<ul>
<li> Class edu.neu.ccs.jmk.Make implements the Operator interface
allowing the invocation of <tt>jmk</tt> from commands in makefiles.
<li> Added class edu.neu.ccs.jmk.shell.JPython which allows commands
to be written in Python.
</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 0.4 to version 0.5</h2>

<ul>
<li> Added the rename and copy file operator.
<li> Added the create operator.
<li> Changed MakeWindow so that it compiles on Linux JDK 1.1.3
</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 0.3 to version 0.4</h2>

<ul>
<li> Added the file inclusion command.
<li> Added conditionals.
<li> Added the <tt>equal</tt> string function.
<li> The Make object stores its associated file as a java.io.File, not
a string.
</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 0.2 to version 0.3</h2>
<ul>
<li> Changed the operator interface so that exec includes a
PrintWriter.  This change was made so that multiple make windows can
be run within one Java virtual machine.
<li> Added a task thread when using the window interface.  Make and 
load run in this thread instead of the window thread.
<li> A make run can be cancelled.  The make run is interrupted as soon
as the currently executing command terminates.
<li> The make short cut was changed from 'M' to 'A' because it invoked
make twice on Windows 95.
<li> Added a menu item that transfers the transcript to the system
clipboard.
<li> Added the note command operator.
<li> Added a Java trademark notice to <tt>index.html</tt>.
</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 0.1 to version 0.2</h2>
<ul>
<li> Changed the jar file name to <tt>jmk.jar</tt>.
<li> Changed the package to <tt>edu.neu.ccs.jmk</tt>.
<li> In class Make, the appropriate methods are now public so that
other applications can easily use the class.
<li> Changed debug mode (<tt>-d</tt>) so that it prints assignments in
addition to the previous information printed about rule interpretation.
<li> Added just print mode (<tt>-n</tt>) which prints, but does not
run commands.
<li> Added a main method in MakeWindow for starting the application in
a window without command line arguments.
<li> All options set on the command line can be set in the make window.
<li> Window size and font information are obtained from the
<tt>jmk.properties</tt> file in the current class path. 
</ul>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>

<p>The next major release will incorporate more features enabled by JDK1.2.
This includes an HTML pane for displaying the user documentation within the
application.

<p>The semantics of pattern rules should be more like those in GNU Make.

<p>In a block, a sequence of local assignments of function constants
should create mutually recursive definitions.

<p>The program should use the internationalization facilities to
produce error messages in multiple languages.

<p>Suggestions for new features are welcome.
